#Programming Talks

I watch a lot of talks that I love to share with my friends, fellows and coworkers.
As I consider all Githubbers my friends(oh yeah!), I decided it's time to share the
list.

I have programmng languages specifics as well as a more general section I call "theory",
but do not expect to always get Theoretical Computer Science for every talk there,
most of them are on the Architecture and Design of Software.

I welcome every contribution to the list!
