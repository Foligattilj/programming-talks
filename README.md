#Programming Talks

I watch a lot of talks that I love to share with my friends, fellows and coworkers.
As I consider all Githubbers my friends(oh yeah!), I decided it's time to share the
list.

I have programmng languages specifics as well as a more general section I call "theory",
but do not expect to always get Theoretical Computer Science for every talk there,
most of them are on the Architecture and Design of Software.

I welcome every contribution to the list!

**Disclaimer:** I did not give any of the talks on the list and am responsible neither
for their content nor for their presentation. All links below will direct you to
external sites(mostly YouTube, really), be aware of that. If you are one of the people
responsible for the talks or the platform presenting it and want it removed,
tell me and I'll sort it out with you.
